# hyperledger-fabric-kubernetes

This repository aims to demonstrate how to deploy an Hyperledger Fabric [v2.4](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.4/) network on Kubernetes, and use chaincodes as external services.

Legacy way of building and runing chaincodes required from the peer, a binding to the Docker socket for being able to
talk with the Docker daemon.

Using chaincode as an external service, the chaincode endpoint is deployed to the peer. The chaincode can be built and lauched separated from the peer. Therefore, there is no more dependency on the Kubernetes CRI implementation.

⚠️ For demo purposes the chaincode package ID is hardcoded. This is mainly due to the fact that the chaincode package has already been generated and is present within the `chaincode-as-external-service` folder. For a given peer version, the chaincode package ID computed will always be the same. If you wish to dynamically generate the chaincode package then you must propagate accordingly the resulting package ID before starting the chaincode server.
You can find one possible solution in the issue [#2](https://github.com/TommyStarK/hyperledger-fabric-kubernetes/issues/3#issuecomment-798954187).

The source code herein is not production ready. It demonstrates what are the building blocks and how you can achieve having your Fabric network running on Kubernetes and use chaincode as an external service. If you want to move to a more production-grade deployment of Fabric you might want to take a look [here](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-operator).

## Usage

- Assuming you have minikube running:

```bash
❯ ./deploy.sh
# wait until all resources are up and running
❯ watch -n 1 kubectl get -n distributedweb-io pods,ingress,secrets,svc,pvc,pv
```

Now, we are going to operate the peer of Org1 and the peer of Org2 in order to create and join a channel as well as install the chaincode.

You'll need two different terminals and run the following commands:

- Terminal 1: CLI configured for the peer of Org1

```bash
# connect to the pod running the CLI for peer0.org1
❯ kubectl exec -it -n distributedweb-io $(kubectl get pod -n distributedweb-io -l component=cli.peer0.org1.distributedweb.io -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") -- bash

❯ cd artifacts
❯ peer channel create -c $CHANNEL_NAME -f ./channelall.tx -o orderer0-distributedweb-io:7050 --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA
❯ peer channel join -b ./channelall.block
❯ cd -
```

- Terminal 2: CLI configured for the peer of Org2

```bash
# connect to the pod running the CLI for peer0.org2
❯ kubectl exec -it -n distributedweb-io $(kubectl get pod -n distributedweb-io -l component=cli.peer0.org2.distributedweb.io -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") -- bash

❯ cd artifacts
❯ peer channel join -b ./channelall.block
❯ cd -
```

At this point the channel has been created, and both peers of Org1 and Org2 have joined the channel.

We can now proceed to install the chaincode.

- Terminal 1: CLI configured for the peer of Org1

```bash
# install the chaincode
❯ peer lifecycle chaincode install ./chaincodes/chaincode-as-external-service/chaincode-as-external-service.tgz
# approve the chaincode for Org1
❯ peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg  -o orderer0-distributedweb-io:7050 --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA --channelID $CHANNEL_NAME --name chaincode-as-external-service --version 1.0 --init-required --package-id chaincode-as-external-service:33b295bb4ac3f8dead7bddb9e86315aa7b3729b76d6d53f9379ddba6db900f7f --sequence 1
```

- Terminal 2: CLI configured for the peer of Org2

```bash
# install the chaincode
❯ peer lifecycle chaincode install ./chaincodes/chaincode-as-external-service/chaincode-as-external-service.tgz
# approve the chaincode for Org2
❯ peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg  -o orderer0-distributedweb-io:7050 --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA --channelID $CHANNEL_NAME --name chaincode-as-external-service --version 1.0 --init-required --package-id chaincode-as-external-service:33b295bb4ac3f8dead7bddb9e86315aa7b3729b76d6d53f9379ddba6db900f7f --sequence 1
```

We are almost done, chaincode has been approved by both Org1 and Org2, we can now commit the chaincode before invoking it.

- Terminal 1: CLI configured for the peer of Org1

```bash
# You can check the commit readiness of the chaincode by running:
❯ peer lifecycle chaincode checkcommitreadiness -o orderer0-distributedweb-io:7050 --channelID $CHANNEL_NAME --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA --name chaincode-as-external-service --version 1.0 --init-required --sequence 1

# It should output something like:
# Chaincode definition for chaincode 'chaincode-as-external-service', version '1.0', sequence '1' on channel 'channelall' approval status by org:
# Org1MSP: true
# Org2MSP: true
# Org3MSP: false


# commit the chaincode
❯ peer lifecycle chaincode commit -o orderer0-distributedweb-io:7050 --channelID $CHANNEL_NAME --name chaincode-as-external-service --version 1.0 --sequence 1 --init-required --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA --peerAddresses peer0-org1-distributedweb-io:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles $CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE  --peerAddresses peer0-org2-distributedweb-io:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles /etc/hyperledger/fabric/crypto/peerOrganizations/org2.distributedweb.io/peers/peer0.org2.distributedweb.io/tls/ca.crt
```

That's it ! The chaincode is ready to be invoked :smile:.

- Terminal 1: CLI configured for the peer of Org1

```bash
# init and invoke the chaincode
❯ peer chaincode invoke -o orderer0-distributedweb-io:7050 --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA -C $CHANNEL_NAME -n chaincode-as-external-service  --peerAddresses peer0-org1-distributedweb-io:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles $CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE  --peerAddresses peer0-org2-distributedweb-io:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles /etc/hyperledger/fabric/crypto/peerOrganizations/org2.distributedweb.io/peers/peer0.org2.distributedweb.io/tls/ca.crt --isInit -c '{"function":"Init","Args":[]}'
```

- Terminal 2: CLI configured for the peer of Org2

```bash
# query the chaincode
❯ peer chaincode query -C $CHANNEL_NAME -n chaincode-as-external-service -c '{"Args":["Query", "default-asset"]}'
```

## Exposing Fabric components through an Ingress

Before we clean everything, let's take a look at how to expose Fabric components through a Kubernetes Ingress.
As we are running our demo against `minikube`, we need to enable the ingress addon.

NB: For macOS users, you need to install [this](https://github.com/chipmk/docker-mac-net-connect) before going further.

```bash
❯ minikube addons enable ingress
```

Before pursuing, ensure that the Nginx Ingress Controller is running properly:

```bash
❯ kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx

NAME                                        READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
ingress-nginx-admission-create-585xm        0/1     Completed   0          8m44s
ingress-nginx-admission-patch-mzsng         0/1     Completed   0          8m44s
ingress-nginx-controller-5959f988fd-nmffb   1/1     Running     0          8m44s
```

Everything is fine, we can proceed and deploy our ingress:

```bash
❯ kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress/orderer0.yaml
```

We are almost done, as we are running our demo locally we need a few more things to setup:

```bash
# retrieve the external IP
❯ EXTERNAL_IP=$(minikube ip)

# configure your local setup
❯ sudo -- sh -c 'echo "\n'"$EXTERNAL_IP"' operations.orderer0.distributedweb.io\n" >> /etc/hosts'
```

That's it ! Let's run a health check of the `orderer0.distributedweb.io` :smile:.

```bash
❯ curl https://operations.orderer0.distributedweb.io/healthz -Lk
{"status":"OK","time":"2022-12-02T10:35:39.704828282Z"}
```


## Cleanup

```bash
❯ kubectl delete statefulset,deployment,ingress,service,job,secrets,pvc --all --namespace distributedweb-io && kubectl delete pv local-volume
```
